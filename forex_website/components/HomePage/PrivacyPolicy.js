In the event Aboota.io enters a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information may be among the assets transferred.  We’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>As Required by Law</h2>
            <p>We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the law or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Aboota.io’s rights or property, other site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Aboota.io may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our services.  </p>

We cannot, however, guarantee that those third parties will continue to adhere to those laws and regulations at all times.
            </p>

            <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
            <p>Using magic, of course!  Just kidding.

We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, as well as restrict access to personal information to a limited set of company employees or service providers that are subject to the obligation of strict confidentiality as relates to that information, and who will be subject to discipline, including termination, if they violate that obligation.
            </p>
