            <h1>Risk Disclosure</h1>

            <h1>TRADING IS NOT SUITABLE FOR EVERYONE. IF YOU DON’T KNOW WTF YOU’RE DOING, TRADING FOREX CAN CAUSE YOU TO COMPLETELY LOSE ALL OF YOUR MONEY.</h1>

            
            <p>FOREIGN CURRENCY TRADING IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND RISKY.</p>

            <p>IT IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND, AND ARE WILLING TO TAKE ON, THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER RISKS INVOLVED, AND WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO WITHSTAND LOSSES THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAT ANY DEPOSITS YOU HAVE MADE.</p>

            <p>Financial instruments that are traded on leverage carry a high level of risk and you could lose more than your deposits.</p>

           <p>Trading on a leveraged basis means a small market movement will have a proportionally larger impact on your position and could result in a total loss of your deposit(s).</p>

          <p>The high leverage associated with trading foreign currency can result in significant losses due to price changes, especially during periods of volatility in the underlying market.
        Please ensure you fully understand the risks and carefully consider your financial situation and trading experience before trading.
        Trading forex on margin carries a HIGH LEVEL OF RISK, and may not be suitable for all investors. Before participating in the FX market, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.
        You should trade in foreign currency contracts only if you understand the contracts (and contractual relationships) into which you are entering and the extent of your exposure to risk.
        The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose!
        The high degree of leverage associated with trading currencies means that the degree of risk compared to other financial products is higher.
        The leveraged nature of forex trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds.
        Leverage (or margin trading) may work against you resulting in substantial loss. And a feeling a sensation similar to getting sucker-punched in the stomach. And then in the face. And then in the throat.
        There is considerable exposure to risk in any off-exchange foreign exchange transaction, including, but not limited to, leverage, creditworthiness, limited regulatory protection and market volatility that may substantially affect the price, or liquidity of a currency or currency pair.
        You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading
        Seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.
